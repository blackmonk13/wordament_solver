## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Wordament Solver is a Python project that helps you find words in Wordament puzzles. It uses image processing techniques to extract the grid data from a screenshot of the game, and then employs a trie data structure to efficiently search for valid words in the puzzle. The project also displays the highest-scoring words and shows the path of each word on the grid using arrows.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get started with Wordament Solver, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/blackmonk13/wordament_solver.git
```
2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the project using a sample puzzle or a screenshot of the game.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

You can use Wordament Solver in two ways:

1. **Sample puzzle:** Define a sample puzzle using the `Cell` class and pass it to the `find_words` function. The function will return a list of highest-scoring words along with their scores and paths.

Example:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    trie = load_word_list()
    cells = [
        [Cell('E', 2), Cell('S', 2), Cell('F', 5), Cell('E', 2)],
        [Cell('L', 3), Cell('A', 2), Cell('B', 5), Cell('D', 3)],
        [Cell('R', 2), Cell('S', 2), Cell('M', 4), Cell('G', 4)],
        [Cell('E', 2), Cell('I', 2), Cell('U', 4), Cell('E', 2)],
    ]
    puzzle = Puzzle(cells)
    words = find_words(puzzle, trie)

    # Print the highest-scoring words
    print('Highest-scoring words:')
    for word, score, path in words:
        print(f'{word}: {score}')
```

2. **Screenshot of the game:** Use the `get_latest_image` function to load a screenshot of the game, extract the grid data, and pass it to the `find_words` function. The function will return a list of highest-scoring words along with their scores and paths. Additionally, it will display an OpenCV image with the word score and a grid with arrows showing how to match the word.

Example:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    latest_image = get_latest_image("data/")
    # Load the cropped image of the grid using OpenCV
    grid = get_grid(latest_image)

    cells = get_grid_data(grid)

    # Create a Puzzle object from the extracted data
    puzzle = Puzzle(cells)
    print(puzzle)

    # Find all valid words in the puzzle
    trie = load_word_list()
    words = find_words(puzzle, trie)

    # Print the highest-scoring words
    print('Highest-scoring words:')
    for word, score, path in words:
        print(f'{word}: {score}')

    img = generate_grid_image(puzzle)

    for i, word_data in enumerate(words):
        word_img = img.copy()  # Create a copy of the original image for each word
        word_img = draw_word_arrows(word_data, word_img)

        display_word_image(word_data, word_img)
```
