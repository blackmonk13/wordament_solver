## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Wordament Solver is a Python project that helps you find words in Wordament puzzles. It uses image processing techniques to extract the grid data from a screenshot of the game, and then employs a trie data structure to efficiently search for valid words in the puzzle. The project also displays the highest-scoring words and shows the path of each word on the grid using arrows.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get started with Wordament Solver, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/blackmonk13/wordament_solver.git
```
2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the project using a sample puzzle or a screenshot of the game.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### CLI Usage

```
python -m wordament_solver -h
```
When you have a cropped grid image like the following 

<img src="sample_images/grid/regular_grid.jpg" alt="Grid Image" width="400" height="auto">


``` python
python -m wordament_solver --image sample_images/grid/regular_grid.jpg --cropped --view
```
